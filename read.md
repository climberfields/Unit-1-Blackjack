# H1 Welcome to BlackJack!

### H3 This game is different than maybe any other that you have played.
The theme of this this game is Marvel Vs DC. So choose your alter ego and get to work!

### If you're not familiar with BlackJack, the object of the game is to get 21 or as close to it as possible without going over; if the dealer goes over 21 you win. You are initially dealt two cards and you have the option to either "Hit" (take a card), or to "Stay" (not take a card and let the dealer go).

## The Rules

1. Every card has a value
  a. Face cards = 10
  b. Aces = 1 or 11
2. You go first, once you press stay, the dealer then goes
3. The dealer plays by the same rules as you, if they go over 21 then they lose
4. Play as many times as you want
